## Abstract
Many machine learning algorithms have been developed in recent history. We will explore the
performance of some of the most common models in this paper given a categorical or a binary
classification problem on text files. These models include Adaboost, linear SVC, linear regression,
radial basis function SVM, random forest, decision tree, and BERT. Our results show the effects
of regularization, resampling methods such as bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and 5-fold crossvalidation
as well as boosting on model accuracy. We also examine the effects of these strategies on
bias-variance tradeoff to determine the best models for each algorithm and data set. Our highest test
accuracies were achieved using BERT: 72.40% on 20 Newsgroups and 94.15% on IMDb.
